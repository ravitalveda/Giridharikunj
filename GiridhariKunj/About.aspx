            Spread at about 4.5 acres, this “Farm Project” – Hare Krishna Mandiram is a humble offering to His Divine Grace Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder Acarya- International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), who paid great emphasis on the development of such self-sustaining farm communities where devotees could lead a simple God-centred life.

            <strong>“..Our farm projects are an extremely important part of our movement. We must become self-sufficient by growing our own grains and producing our own milk, and then there will be no question of poverty. So develop these farm communities as far as possible. They should be developed as an ideal society depending on natural products not industry…”
