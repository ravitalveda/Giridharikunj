                    Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s main mission is
                            harinaam sankritan. Every week devotees perform harinaam sankirtan

                <p>
                    For regular connected devotees to temple we
                            hold systematic study of Bhagavad Gita & other preliminary books on
                            Sunday morning in temple premises.

                <b>Go Seva </b>
                <p>
                    Krsna loves cows & is satisfied with those who have love of
                            cows in their heart. Keeping the mood we are serving & taking care of
                            9 cows & 5 calf’s. Goshala is located just beside the main temple.
                       
                </p>
                <b>Organic Farming</b>
                <p>
                    All economic problems can be solved by just having a
                            cow & piece of land for farming. With this view we are growing
                            different vegetables, fruits, corns, & other cereals. There is plenty
                            of flower plantation within the perimeter of temple.
