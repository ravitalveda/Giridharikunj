                        <p>
                            Srila Prabhupada was born Abhay Charan De on September 1, 1896, to a
                            pious Hindu family in Calcutta. As a youth growing up in
                            British-controlled India, Abhay became involved with Mahatma Gandhi’s
                            civil disobedience movement to secure independence for his nation. It
                            was, however, a 1922 meeting with a prominent scholar and religious
                            leader, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, which proved most influential
                            on Abhay’s future calling. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta was a leader in the
                            Gaudiya Vaishnava denomination, a monotheistic tradition within the
                            broad Hindu culture, and asked Abhay to bring the teachings of Lord
                            Krishna to the English-speaking world.

                        <p>
                            Abhay became a disciple of
                            Srila Bhaktisiddhanta in 1933, and resolved to carry out his mentor’s
                            request. Abhay, later known by the honorific A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
                            Prabhupada, spent the next 32 years preparing for his journey to west.
                            In 1965, at the age of sixty-nine, Srila Prabhupada travelled to New
                            York City aboard a cargo ship. The journey was treacherous, and the
                            elderly spiritual teacher suffered two heart attacks aboard ship.
                            Arriving in the United States with just seven dollars in Indian rupees
                            and his translations of sacred Sanskrit texts, Srila Prabhupada began
                            to share the timeless wisdom of Krishna consciousness.

                        <p>
                            His message of
                            peace and goodwill resonated with many young people, some of whom came
                            forward to become serious students of the Krishna tradition. With the
                            help of these students, Srila Prabhupada rented a small storefront on
                            New York’s Lower East Side to use as a temple. On July 11, 1966, he
                            officially registered his organization in the state of New York,
                            formally founding the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.
                            In the eleven years that followed, Srila Prabhupada circled the globe
                            14 times on lecture tours, bringing the teachings of Lord Krishna to
                            thousands of people on six continents. Men and women from all
                            backgrounds and walks of life came forward to accept his message, and
                            with their help, Srila Prabhupadaestablished ISKCON centers and
                            projects throughout the world. Under his inspiration, Krishna devotees
                            established temples, rural communities, educational institutions, and
                            started what would become the world’s largest vegetarian food relief
                            program. With the desire to nourish the roots of Krishna consciousness
                            in its home, Srila Prabhupada returned to India several times, where
                            he sparked a revival in the Vaishnava tradition. In India, he opened
                            dozens of temples, including large centers in the holy towns of
                            Vrindavana and Mayapur.
                            Srila Prabhupada’s most significant contributions, perhaps, are his
                            books. He authored over 70 volumes on the Krishna tradition, which are
                            highly respected by scholars for their authority, depth, fidelity to
                            the tradition, and clarity. Several of his works are used as textbooks
                            in numerous college courses. His writings have been translated into 76
                            languages. His most prominent works include: Bhagavad-gita As It Is,
                            the 30-volume Srimad-Bhagavatam, and the 17-volume Sri
                            Chaitanya-charitamrita.
